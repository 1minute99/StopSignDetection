# Stop Sign Detection on Embedded Device

This is an **end-to-end Stop Sign Detection** project using an **embedded device (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)**.  
When the user makes a hand gesture resembling a stop sign, the device captures an image, runs a deep learning model for classification, and lights up an LED:

- **Blue LED**: Capturing image  
- **Green LED**: Stop sign detected  
- **Red LED**: Stop sign not detected
